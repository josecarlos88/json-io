<h1>notes</h1>
<b>json.io</b>

1) adding in other packages from <b>npm</b>
2) <b>get</b> and <b>post</b> are ways of <i>sending data across the network</i>, this is a direct peer-to-peer connection. You're not really communicating with the server, but like bittorrent and Skyper, you're communicating directly with the other node / user.
3) <b>get</b> is a request for some data. it's <i>insecure</i>, so don't use anything with sensitive data, it logs in your browser history and it's trackable. Its you on your device asking a server for information. Linking a file, font or image is a form of <i>get</i>
4) <b>post</b> is where things get a little crazier. We're not sending any data with <b>get</b> other than the name of what we want. <b>Post</b> sends some data to the server, the server does some computation, then sends back a response related to the post. Any service you use online is a <b>post request</b>, with a server logging your <b>username + password</b> and accepting or denying it.
5) Web sockets are setting up a generic channel between the server and you, it could be used for many things. <b>socket.io</b> balloons it out to deal with everybody who's using the server, which is anybody whose browser is at that site.

we installed <i>node package manager</i>

Drag folder into <b>terminal</b> to easily <i>change directory 'cd'</i>
1) npm init
2) npm install --save (name of the package you want)
3) npm install --save <i>jsonfile</i> or <i>express</i>

<h6>how to require in the server.js</h6>
var express = require('express'); // requires express

<h6>Booting up the server:</h6>
in the right directory
in <b>TERMINAL</b>: <i>node server.js</i>
this runs the server, initializing its little whip

<b>EADDRINUSE</b> = you are using the port somewhere else
control + c = quit the server



we need a <b>json</b> package, so we head over to <b>npm</b> online, and the one Ben picked is <i>json file</i>
